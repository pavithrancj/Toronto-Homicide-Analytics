# üïµÔ∏è Toronto Police Homicide Analytics

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of homicide incidents in the city of Toronto by leveraging open data from the Toronto Police Department and Open Ottawa Portal. By applying data analytics, statistical modeling, and exploratory visualizations, the project aims to generate actionable insights to support law enforcement, policymakers, and community organizations in reducing crime and enhancing public safety.

Key areas of focus include:
- Identifying spatial and temporal trends in homicide incidents  
- Analyzing resource allocation and response times  
- Evaluating the impact of external factors (e.g., immigration trends, economic shifts)  
- Integrating data across multiple jurisdictions (Toronto & Ottawa)
- Predicting Future Homicide trends using Machine Learning
